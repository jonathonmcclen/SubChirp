# Sub Chirp: The Ultimate Subtweet Experience

Welcome to Sub Chirp, the Twitter clone project with a twist! Built using Ruby on Rails, Sub Chirp takes the concept of subtweets - or as Gen Z calls them, "sub chirps" - to a whole new level.

## Project Description

Sub Chirp offers users the opportunity to write subtweets about anyone or anything without directly mentioning them. The challenge? Users must guess who the subtweets are about based on the context provided. If someone guesses correctly, the app confirms their guess, adding an element of intrigue and excitement to the experience.

## Features

- **Subtweeting**: Craft your own cleverly worded subtweets about anything or anyone.
- **Guessing Game**: Test your deduction skills by guessing who other users' subtweets are about.
- **Confirmation System**: If you guess correctly, the app confirms your guess, adding a satisfying twist to the interaction.
- **User Profiles**: Customize your profile, view your subtweets, and see how many guesses you've gotten right.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for subtweets by keywords or usernames.
